```
We can see a repository named **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples** with a tag of **aspnetapp**. This means that docker has pulled the image successfully. 
5. Next, let us get the image run in the background as container and also expose on the web. 
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

6. Access the web app<p>
To access the wep app in the browser, we nopen a web browser and enter the URL for the sample web app: **http://localhost:8080**. You should see a page that looks like the following screenshot:<p>

![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/249dc183-e125-44ee-9e92-8feb056673b4)<p>

We can confirm from **docker desktop**if the image and container exist. <p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/ea307f5e-fcf3-4bbf-b5ca-13df86e720aa)<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/7a45c1c8-ae86-4a1c-9449-a5adaac87e36)<p>

## Perform operations on the the container in the local Docker registry
1. View the running containers in the local registry.
```
docker ps
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/9f8e3c4b-0f5a-4b00-b7bc-95393de13828)<p>

The COMMAND field shows the container was started by running the command 'dotnet aspnetapp.dll', which invokes the .NET Core runtime to start the sample web app code. The PORTS field indicates `port 8080` in the container was mapped to `port 8080` on the host computer. The STATUS field shows the application is still running. 

2. Stop the Docker container using the output name or container ID from the previous command by replacing the placeholder <NAME>/<container id>

```
docker container stop <name>/<container ID>
```
3. Use the command below to check if the container is no longer running. Use the -a flag to display the status of all containers, including those that are not running. The output should indicate that the container's status is Exited.
```
docker ps -a
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/12755279-dd15-4cc5-8775-58f3fc0d1705)<p>

4. Confirm from the browser if the web app has stopped.<p>
Refresh the page for the sample web app in opened earlier in the web browser (http://localhost:8080/). It should fail with a **Connection Refused error**.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/0d3f555b-c108-4f4d-92a4-9135dd19cd79)<p>

## Remove the container and image from the local registry
1. Stop the container, it is still loaded and can be restarted. Run the following command in the command prompt window to remove it, replacing `<NAME>` or `<ID>` placeholder with the name of your container. Run:
```
docker container rm <NAME>
```
The image status on docker desktop, `unsued` indicates the container has been removed.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/46f5314e-6d2d-4d29-8c5b-18f2d5b57e97)<p>

2. Verify container removal by running the command. The command should no longer list the container.
```
docker ps -a
```
It is remove and not running.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/4fca4d75-5ddc-4245-bfef-78b60f810ba2)<p>
3. List the images currently available on your computer. The output should show the samples repository.<p>
```

# Customise a Docker Image to run a Personlised Web App
We have looked at how we can pull an image from **Docker Hub**. Docker Hub offers a great selection of images to help kickstart our containerised app development. You can easily obtain an image with the essential features DevOps need and then add our own application on top of it to create a personalised image. To streamline this process, we can automate the steps by creating a **Dockerfile**. <p>

A **Dockerfile** contains the steps for building a custom Docker image.<p>
When a DevOps choses to utilise `Docker` to deploy one of the organisation's web applications. The selected web app is a straightforward implementation of a web `API` for a hotel reservations website. The web API allows for `HTTP POST` and `GET` operations to create and retrieve customer bookings.<p><p>

In this section, we will create a `Dockerfile` for a web application that currently does not have one. Afterward, build the image and run it in our local environment.

## Create a Dockerfile for the web app
1. Start `Docker Desktop`
2. Make a new directory called booking_web_app and `cd` into it 
```
mkdir booking_web_app    # creates the working directoy 
cd booking_web_app       # change directory to booking_web_app
``` 
3. Clone the web app repo: Execute the command in your local computer's command prompt window or a terminal in an IDE to download the source code for the web app.
```
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-hotel-reservation-system.git
```
4. Change directory to mslearn-hotel-reservation-system and list the files within.
```
cd mslearn-hotel-reservation-system
ls
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/731558c5-9d63-4d66-bb07-91f3304b7204)<p>
There is a sourcecode (`src`) amongst the listed output. This is the source code to build the web app. <p>
4. Enter the following command to open the `src` directory.
```
cd mslearn-hotel-reservation-system/src
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/d8e91104-13c3-49e4-93e2-67317e02e80f)<p>
5. In the src directory, use the following commands to generate a new file called Dockerfile and then open it in Notepad or Text editor.
```
copy NUL Dockerfile               # Create the Dockerfile on windows cmd prompt
notepad Dockerfile                # Edit the Dockerfile in Windows Notepa
#######################################################################################
vi Dockerfile                   # Create and edit the Dockerfile in Linux/Mac/GitBash
```
6. Add the following code to the Dockerfile:
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["/HotelReservationSystem/HotelReservationSystem.csproj", "HotelReservationSystem/"]
COPY ["/HotelReservationSystemTypes/HotelReservationSystemTypes.csproj", "HotelReservationSystemTypes/"]
RUN dotnet restore "HotelReservationSystem/HotelReservationSystem.csproj"
```
The `Dockerfile` script includes instructions to retrieve an image that includes the **.NET Core Framework SDK**. It also copies the project files for the web app `(HotelReservationSystem.csproj)` and the library project `(HotelReservationSystemTypes.csproj)` to the **/src** folder within the container. Additionally, the `dotnet restore` command is used to download the necessary dependencies from **NuGet** for these projects.
7. Append the following code to the bottom of the Dockerfile:
```
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/HotelReservationSystem"
RUN dotnet build "HotelReservationSystem.csproj" -c Release -o /app
```
Copy the web app's source code to the container and then execute the dotnet build command to compile the app. The compiled DLLs will be saved to the /app directory within the container. 

8. Add the following command to the end of the Dockerfile.
```
RUN dotnet publish "HotelReservationSystem.csproj" -c Release -o /app
```
The `dotnet publish` command transfers the website's executable files to a fresh directory while eliminating any temporary files. The files in this directory can be deployed to a website.
9. At the end of the Dockerfile, add
```
EXPOSE 80
WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "HotelReservationSystem.dll"]
```
The `initial` command, `EXPOSE 80`, allows access to port 80 within the container. The subsequent command navigates to the `/app` directory where the published version of the web app is located. The last command sets the container to run and execute the `dotnet HotelReservationSystem.dll` command, which contains the compiled code for the web app.
10. Please save the document and then close the text editor. 
**N/B**: In Windows Notepad, ensure that it is save as `All Files` with no file extension.<p>
The full `Dockerfile` will look like this:
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["/HotelReservationSystem/HotelReservationSystem.csproj", "HotelReservationSystem/"]
COPY ["/HotelReservationSystemTypes/HotelReservationSystemTypes.csproj", "HotelReservationSystemTypes/"]
RUN dotnet restore "HotelReservationSystem/HotelReservationSystem.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/HotelReservationSystem"
RUN dotnet build "HotelReservationSystem.csproj" -c Release -o /app
RUN dotnet publish "HotelReservationSystem.csproj" -c Release -o /app
EXPOSE 80
WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "HotelReservationSystem.dll"]
```
## Build and deploy the image using the Dockerfile
1. Build the Image: use the following commands to create the image for the sample app using the Dockerfile. Ensure to include a period `.` at the end of the command. This command will create the image and save it locally with the name reservationsystem. Confirm that the image is successfully created. When the process is complete, we may see warnings about file and directory permissions, which can be ignored for this exercise.<p>
**Note**:The image may take some time to build.
```
docker build -t reservationsystem .
```
The docker build command operates by creating a container, executing commands within it, and subsequently saving the modifications as a new image.<p>
**output**:
```

2. List images: We will verify that the the `Dockerfile` execution has created the image and saved in the locally registry:
```
docker image list
```
**output**: The image will have the name `reservationsystem`. We'll also have an image named microsoft/dotnet:
```
REPOSITORY                       TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
reservationsystem                latest        91e4b40129c0   7 minutes ago   1.87GB
```
Let is confirm from the `Docker Desktop`:<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/9438c04b-8f3f-4e18-a618-ab9338859206)<p>

## Test the web app
1. Run a container using the `reservationsystem` image: The output from Docker will be a long hexadecimal string. The container operates without a graphical interface in the background. `Port 80` within the container is linked or mapped to `port 8080` on the host machine. The container's name is `reservations`.
```
docker run -p 8080:80 -d --name reservations reservationsystem
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/2a03da68-6ecb-4fe6-9ab8-3a46ac9f5683)<p>
From the `Docker Desktop`, we can confirm if the container is running.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/81db78be-c9a6-4de1-a0c9-034b4f2ef644)<p>
We can see that the image status is `In Use` as compared to the status `Unuse` before running the container. See the container named `reservations` running the image `reservationsystem`:<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/93df9034-e589-44ee-b5f3-c71298fca442)<p>
2. Access the web app in the browser: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/api/reservations/1` . We will be able to view a JSON object displaying the data for reservation number 1, similar to the example output shown below:<p>

# Deploy a Docker image to an Azure Container Instance
Previously, we packaged and tested a booking web app as a Docker image for local use. Now, the aim to utilise the results of that process to deploy the web application globally. To achieve this global availability, we will launch the image as an `Azure Container Instance`. <p>
`Azure Container Instance` allows DevOps team to run a Docker image within the Azure environment.<p>

In this section, we will learn how to rebuild the image for the web app and then transfer it to Azure Container Registry. Afterwards, we will utilize the Azure Container Instance service to run the image.
## Create a container registry
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com).
**N/B**: Azure subscription to to run this exercise, and might incur charges.
2. In the `Azure portal`, select `Create a resource` from the resource menu or the Home page to open the Create a resource pane.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/f0f7de6e-981e-4327-a851-5c67d9b0b42d)<p>
3. Choose `Containers` from the menu, then click on `Container Registry`.<p>

The pane for creating a container registry is displayed.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/85cf8a86-a148-4027-9d32-118071660e50)<p>

4. Input the specified values for each setting on the Basics tab.
Under `Project details`:<p>
- `Subscription` - Select your Azure subscription in which you're allowed to create and manage resources.
- `Resource group` - Create a new resource group with the name "learn-deploy-container-aci-rg". Remember this name, as it will be used in the rest of the project.<p>
**N/B**: We will clean up this resource when the project is completed.<p>

Under `Instance details`:
- `Registry name`  - Choose a name for the container registry. The registry name must be unique within Azure and contain between 5 and 50 alphanumeric characters.
- `Location` - Choose a location that is geographically close to you.
- `SKU` - Standard<p>

6.Click on `Go to resource`. This launch the Container registry pane, which displays key information about your newly created container registry.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/ab27256a-be1f-480a-8eff-f6fa23a839a7)<p>

7. In the resource menu, under the `Settings` section, click the dropdown next to settings and select `Access keys`. This will open the Access keys pane for your container registry.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/8324807a-8df8-429a-8ee3-14c897366b0b)<p>

8. If the Admin user setting is currently disabled, toggle the slider to enable the Admin user access key. Once enabled, the Username and Password for your container registry will be displayed.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/d44d1518-3b6a-402e-8810-cfd7723c4096)<p>

9. Record the following information for your container registry: the `Registry name`, `Login server`, `Username`, and `Password`.<p>
**N/B**: In this project, we are enabling the `admin account access` to allow for uploading images and testing the registry. However, in a `production environment`, it's important to `disable the Admin user account access` and instead use `Microsoft Entra ID Protection` as soon as you've confirmed the registry is functioning as expected.
## Upload the image for the hotel reservation system app to Azure Container Registry
1. Run the following command, replacing `<registry-name>` with the actual name of your container registry, to tag the current `reservationsystem` image with the name of your registry.
```
docker tag reservationsystem:latest <registry-name>.azurecr.io/reservationsystem:latest
```
2. Execute the `docker image ls` command to verify that the image has been tagged correctly.
```
docker image ls
```
The `output` should be similar to the following:
```
REPOSITORY                                            TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
reservationsystem                                     latest        91e4b40129c0   14 hours ago   1.87GB
jonesdeploywebappaci25.azurecr.io/reservationsystem   latest        91e4b40129c0   14 hours ago   1.87GB
```
This image has also been populated in **Docker Desktop**.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/f1ffa66d-c90f-4e65-8dd3-420f3f294ac3)<p>

3. Sign in to the Azure Container Registry created. Use the `docker login` command and provide the login server for the registry that was noted earlier. When prompted, enter the username and password from the access keys you recorded previously.
```
docker login <login-server>
```
**N/B**: You may encounter an error message indicating that your application is not registered with Microsoft Entra ID. As mentioned earlier in this exercise, we have enabled the Admin user access key to facilitate testing of the deployment.
4. Enter the following command, replacing `<registry-name>` with the actual name of th registry created, to upload the image to your Azure Container Registry.
```
docker push <registry-name>.azurecr.io/reservationsystem:latest
```
## Verify the contents of the registry
1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to your container registry.

2. Under the Services section in the resource menu, select Repositories. This will take you to the Repositories pane for your container registry.

3. Verify that the **reservationsystem** repository is present. Select the **reservationsystem** repository and confirm that it contains an image with the **latest** tag.<p>
