## Retrieve an existing Docker image and deploy it locally.

### Pull and run a sample application from Docker Hub
1. Start **Docker (dockerdesktop)** locally.
2. Open a command prompt window on your local computer.
3. Enter the code below to pull the ASP.NET Sample app image from the Docker Hub registry. This image contains a sample web app developed by Microsoft, and is based on the default ASP.NET template available in Visual Studio.
```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

**Output**:
```

4. Wait for docker to complete pulling the image, then enter the following code to verify that the image has been stored locally.
```
docker image ls
```

**Output**:
```

```
We can see a repository named **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples** with a tag of **aspnetapp**. This means that docker has pulled the image successfully. 
5. Next, let us get the image run in the background as container and also expose on the web. 
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

6. Access the web app<p>
To access the wep app in the browser, we nopen a web browser and enter the URL for the sample web app: **http://localhost:8080**. You should see a page that looks like the following screenshot:<p>

We can confirm from **docker desktop**if the image and container exist. <p>
