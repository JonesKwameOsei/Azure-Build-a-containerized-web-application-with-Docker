## Retrieve an existing Docker image and deploy it locally.

### Pull and run a sample application from Docker Hub
1. Start **Docker (dockerdesktop)** locally.
2. Open a command prompt window on your local computer.
3. Enter the code below to pull the ASP.NET Sample app image from the Docker Hub registry. This image contains a sample web app developed by Microsoft, and is based on the default ASP.NET template available in Visual Studio.
```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

**Output**:
```

4. Wait for docker to complete pulling the image, then enter the following code to verify that the image has been stored locally.
```
docker image ls
```

**Output**:
```

We can see a repository named **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples** with a tag of **aspnetapp**. This means that docker has pulled the image successfully. 
5. Next, let us get the image run in the background as container and also expose on the web. 
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

6. Access the web app<p>
To access the wep app in the browser, we nopen a web browser and enter the URL for the sample web app: **http://localhost:8080**. You should see a page that looks like the following screenshot:<p>

![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/249dc183-e125-44ee-9e92-8feb056673b4)<p>

We can confirm from **docker desktop**if the image and container exist. <p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/ea307f5e-fcf3-4bbf-b5ca-13df86e720aa)<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/7a45c1c8-ae86-4a1c-9449-a5adaac87e36)<p>

## Perform operations on the the container in the local Docker registry
1. View the running containers in the local registry.
```
docker ps
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/9f8e3c4b-0f5a-4b00-b7bc-95393de13828)<p>

The COMMAND field shows the container was started by running the command 'dotnet aspnetapp.dll', which invokes the .NET Core runtime to start the sample web app code. The PORTS field indicates `port 8080` in the container was mapped to `port 8080` on the host computer. The STATUS field shows the application is still running. 

2. Stop the Docker container using the output name or container ID from the previous command by replacing the placeholder <NAME>/<container id>

```
docker container stop <name>/<container ID>
```
3. Use the command below to check if the container is no longer running. Use the -a flag to display the status of all containers, including those that are not running. The output should indicate that the container's status is Exited.
```
docker ps -a
```
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/12755279-dd15-4cc5-8775-58f3fc0d1705)<p>

4. Confirm from the browser if the web app has stopped.<p>
Refresh the page for the sample web app in opened earlier in the web browser (http://localhost:8080/). It should fail with a **Connection Refused error**.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/0d3f555b-c108-4f4d-92a4-9135dd19cd79)<p>

## Remove the container and image from the local registry
1. Stop the container, it is still loaded and can be restarted. Run the following command in the command prompt window to remove it, replacing `<NAME>` or `<ID>` placeholder with the name of your container. Run
```
docker container rm <NAME>
```
The image status on docker desktop, `unsued` indicates the container has been removed.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/46f5314e-6d2d-4d29-8c5b-18f2d5b57e97)<p>

2. Verify container removal by running the command. The command should no longer list the container.
```
docker ps -a
```
It is remove and not running.<p>
![image](https://github.com/JonesKwameOsei/Build-a-containerized-web-application-with-Docker-/assets/81886509/4fca4d75-5ddc-4245-bfef-78b60f810ba2)<p>
3. List the images currently available on your computer. The output should show the samples repository.<p>
```
docker image ls
```
**Output**:
```

```
docker image rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp

```
The output lists untagged and deleted items. Then, run the command to list the images again and verify that the image for the microsoft/dotnet-samples web app has disappeared.

5. Let us verify if the image has been deleted.
```
docker image ls
```
The output shows that the image is removed.
